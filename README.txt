Connect Slack with Homey to automate your work â€” or just have more fun at it.

SEND MESSAGES TO SLACK
Create a Flow to send any message to any Slack channel or user. For example, use Homey Logic Webhooks to send a message from anywhere to Slack. Or let your team know who's at the office!

START A FLOW FROM SLACK
Start any Flow from Slack by typing `/flow all-lights-on`. Feeling adventurous? Provide a Tag for even more advanced behavior by typing `/flow say Hello World!`.
